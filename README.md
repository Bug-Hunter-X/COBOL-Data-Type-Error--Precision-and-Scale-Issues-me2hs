This repository demonstrates a common data type error in COBOL programs. The `bug.cob` file contains a program that attempts to store a value exceeding the precision of the defined variable `WS-AMOUNT`. This can lead to data truncation or runtime exceptions. The `bugSolution.cob` file provides a corrected version where the data type is adjusted to accommodate the expected values, preventing the error. The README details the bug, its cause, and the implemented solution.
